        Certain visitors to Cycrowd's websites choose to interact with Cycrowd
        in ways that require Cycrowd to gather personally-identifying
        information. The amount and type of information that Cycrowd gathers
        depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors
        who leave a comment at https://www.cycklas.com to provide a username and
        email address.

        Cycrowd discloses potentially personally-identifying and
        personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
        contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
        information in order to process it on Cycrowd's behalf or to provide
        services available at Cycrowd's website, and (ii) that have agreed not
        to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and
        affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
        using Cycrowd's website, you consent to the transfer of such information
        to them. Cycrowd will not rent or sell potentially
        personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
        Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations,
        as described above, Cycrowd discloses potentially personally-identifying
        and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena,
        court order or other governmental request, or when Cycrowd believes in
        good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the
        property or rights of Cycrowd, third parties or the public at large.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you are a registered user of https://www.cycklas.com and have
        supplied your email address, Cycrowd may occasionally send you an email
        to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you
        up to date with what's going on with Cycrowd and our products. We
        primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we
        expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request
        (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms),
        we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or
        respond to your request or to help us support other users. Cycrowd takes
        all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized
        access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially
        personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

        on your computer.
        <br />
        <br />A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a

        Those who engage in transactions with Cycrowd â€“ by purchasing Cycrowd's
        services or products, are asked to provide additional information,
        including as necessary the personal and financial information required
        to process those transactions. In each case, Cycrowd collects such
        information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the
        purpose of the visitor's interaction with Cycrowd. Cycrowd does not
        disclose personally-identifying information other than as described
        below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying

        <Typography variant="h5" children="7. Business Transfers" />
        <br />
        If Cycrowd, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the
        unlikely event that Cycrowd goes out of business or enters bankruptcy,
        user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or
        acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may
        occur, and that any acquirer of Cycrowd may continue to use your
        personal information as set forth in this policy.

        Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Cycrowd's sole discretion.

        changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any
        change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such
        change.
